        livestock, aquaculture, and crops for steady income and resource
        efficiency
      </summary>
      <p style="margin-top: 20px">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; This project proposes a sustainable small-scale
        Integrated Farming System (IFS) on leased land in rural Ernakulam,
        Kerala, designed to generate steady income while ensuring ecological
        balance. The model integrates livestock such as cows, goats, poultry,
        quail, and rabbits with aquaculture including fish and crabs,
        alongside a wide range of crops such as vegetables, tubers, fruits,
        spices, and fodder. This diversity provides continuous production
        throughout the year, ensuring both food security and regular cash
        flow.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 10px; padding-bottom: 40px">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Resource recycling is central to the system:
        animal manure is converted into organic fertilizer and biogas,
        enriching the soil and fishponds, while crop residues are used as
        livestock feed. This reduces dependence on external inputs and lowers
        operating costs. The farm structure balances short-term returns from
        vegetables and eggs, medium-term income from tubers, fish, and goats,
        and long-term gains from milk, fruits, and value-added products. With
        modern practices like drip irrigation, watershed management, and
        vermicomposting, the farm efficiently addresses soil and water
        challenges. Overall, the project is designed to be profitable,
        resilient, and environmentally friendly, supporting sustainable rural
        development while ensuring reliable income for repayment of capital
        investment.
